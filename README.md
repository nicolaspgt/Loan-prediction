# Loan-prediction

This projet is a machine learning project done as part of a course during my Master's Degree in Paris.

## The data

The data is a dataset with credit information and especially the variable associated to a binary value : Yes or No, meaning Yes if the individual has had his loan accepted and No if he has not. 

## Analysis

It's basically analyzing the data (statistically) and then trying to predict the output with all the other variables.
